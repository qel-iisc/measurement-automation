# Measurement

This repository consists of some application scripts and starter examples to 
automate measurement of electrical and optical characteristics of electronic or optoelectronic devices.
They are very useful for more complex measurement setups 
where multiple instruments need to be used to aquire desired data or in cases where large amount of data is to be collected over a long period of time.
